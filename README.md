Heavy Metal GRUB init tune strings:

An effort to help you make your computer way more metal during bootup.

Place the string into /etc/default/grub, use "grub-mkconfig" to regenerate your GRUB configuration file, take a massive bongrip, reboot and rock.

[Note : At this time, I have tested none of these strings on hardware. They were created using BreadMaker's amazing GRUB_INIT_TUNE tester and were not tested further.]

Please visit the following sites to learn to create your own strings:
